				<h2>The Original Post</h2>
				<blockquote>Ever since Michael Jackson died, I've been interested in his life and wanted to know whether or not he really was a pedophile. I was stunned by all the information I found that pointed to his innocence. The U.S. media is evil and has blood on its hand for their slanderous misrepresentation of Michael Jackson's life and the cases against him. There was never any evidence to support their claims that Michael Jackson was a pedophile other than the words of proven and admitted liars motivated by money. In fact, all the evidence including the prosecution's 'evidence' pointed to the man's innocence. I find it disgusting that people continue to propagate the myth that Michael Jackson was a pedophile even though when you ask them why they think that you find out that they know next to nothing about the court cases.</blockquote>
				
				<p>There are so many accusations here and they are so heavy, what do you have to back them up? After all, there was plenty of evidence to support the claim that MJ was a serial child molester. <a href="../michael/relevance-paedo.html">Whether or not he was a paedophile is irrelevant</a>, what is more important is what he did to those poor children. Also, MJ fans love to <a href="../claims/index.html#no-evidence">claim that "there was never any evidence"</a> but this simply isn't true. There was plenty of evidence for MJ's guilt. While there are some people who believe the truth of MJ's guilt don't believe it because of the evidence that backs it, that doesn't mean that everyone who believes the only rational conclusion the evidence points to believes it because <a href="../claims/index.html#rationalists-know-nothing">they "know next to nothing about the court cases"</a>. This is more like an ad hominem attack against the people who believe the facts, which speaks poorly of your position.</p>
				
				<blockquote>I won't waste my time outlining the details of both cases. That information is already out their in books and articles, and even on wikipedia, if anyone's interested. Anyone with a brain should conclude that the 2005 case was pure baloney based on one simple fact. The 'little boy' (he was 15 at the time) could look a Jury point blank in the eye and claim that Michael Jackson held him and his family prisoner at Neverland in addition to plying him with alcohol and molesting him. Meanwhile, the defense could show documented evidence of all the times he and his family 'escaped' from Neverland to spend Michael Jackson's money and then return only to 'escape' again. That alone should have ended the prosecution’s case. The conspiracy and kidnapping charges were more serious than the molestation charges and had a larger prison sentence. If the prosecution could bring those charges against Michael Jackson and the alleged 'victim' could lie about it with a straight face, despite all the obvious evidence that proves them to be false, then they can do anything. The media likes to ignore those conspiracy and kidnapping charges, as if you can choose to disbelieve one part of this kid's story and then believe the other part. If he's comfortable lying about something as serious as kidnapping and has a past history of lying under oath for his mother, then chances are he can lie and make up a fake story about anything. Based only on this I don't need to go any further with the prosecution's evidence. Instead of outlining the cases I'll attack the nonsensical statements that people continue to make to prove the Michael Jackson was a pedophile even though he was never charged in 1993 and was aquitted in 2005.</blockquote>
				
				<p>Yeah, because outlining the details of the case that you're trying to debunk would be a waste of time. After all, facts get in the way of defending a serial child molester like MJ and show your ignorance of the facts backing MJ's guilt. Sure, there is plenty of information in books and articles, but you should at least give a rundown of the points you disagree with. The fact that you make light of MJ committing false imprisonment (a crime throughout the US) and plying Gavin with alcohol and molesting him are also crimes. Additionally, identifying with your captor is a phenomena that psychologists understand well enough to have a name for it - Stockholm syndrome. In addition, MJ likes to groom his victims, just like he did with Jordan Chandler, Wade Robson and Jimmy Safechuck.</p>
				<p>Why do you automatically assume that MJ's victims are lying? It seems that you are defending a position that aligns with your biases instead of looking rationally at the facts of the case. You claim he is lying but don't explain why you think that he is, you just take it for granted. But it is interesting that you only bring up the 2005 case with the Arvizos but not the Chandler case...</p>
				
				<blockquote>People like to claim Michael Jackson was a pedophile based on these idiotic lines of reasoning.</blockquote>
				
				<p>Says the person who makes all sorts of false claims about the Arvizos and has made several false claims about MJ realists already.</p>
				
				<blockquote>1. “He’s spends time with kids instead of women, therefore he is a child molester”. If so how come all the kids he spends time with aren’t accusing him? How come all the victims that exist in your imaginations never come forward with allegations. He’s had thousands of kids at Neverland over the years, and only three accusers, all whose parents happen to be con-artists chasing after money. If they could convict Jackson in criminal court they would automatically be able to wipe him clean in civil court. Money talks. If all these victims are out their they would have come forward for a shot at millions of dollars. Its telling that only the shadiest people manage to come forward.</blockquote>
				
				<p>Well, that's not the only reason why people would think he is a child molester. Besides the overwhelming evidence that proves that MJ was a serial child molester, the fact that MJ was never able to have a healthy relationship with a person who was of age (not just women) is one red flag. In and of itself, that would not be proof of MJ's guilt. There are lots of reasons people can't have healthy relationships with other adults. Additionally, to the date you posted this, there were four accusers (though the first one only claimed MJ was masturbating while on the phone with him).</p>
				<p>But your claim that since MJ had thousands of people at Neverland, no one must have been molested, is false. After all, there are millions of visitors to Paris but only a handful get taken by pickpockets... does that mean that those who do get taken weren't victims of thieves at all? <a href="https://schwingeninswitzerland.wordpress.com/2012/07/26/who-gets-taken-by-this/">In Geneva, there are people who run three-card monty schemes</a> - only a handful of people get taken by these scams but by your logic, <a href="https://www.geneve.ch/police/doc/prevention/bonneteau.pdf">the Geneva Police must be wrong</a> in warning people about three card monty dealers.</p>
				<p>But yes, money talks. Specifically, the millions that MJ paid to keep his victims silent. Plus, to claim that all of the victims would have come forward with money ignores the psychology behind the grooming of victims of child molestation. It's also telling that MJ hung around "the shadiest people".</p>
				
				<blockquote>2. “He paid them off so he’s guilty.” Do you know the difference between a civil case and criminal case? WTF is something as serious as child molestation doing in civil court instead of criminal court. If you think someone molested your kid, you go straight to the cops. You don’t call your lawyer to file a lawsuit and then refuse to cooperate with the police once you get a settlement. Explain to me where in the settlement Michael Jackson's Big Payoff - June 16, 2004 does it say the money is contingent upon the accuser's failure to cooperate with the police. It was the Chandler’s decision and theirs alone to run after taking the money. If you bother to read it (I know its to difficult for idiots) you’d notice MJ claimed he’s innocent in the settlement and accuser and his lawyers agreed to sign it. By this idiotic logic, Janet Arvizo and her children were telling the truth when they claimed that a JC Penny’s security guard beat and sexually abused her because JC Penny settled with her for more than 100,000. Please.</blockquote>
				
				<p>Well, the Chandler case was having a hard time getting past the Grand Jury. A civil trial would have brought a lot of evidence to the surface and would have made getting the Grand Jury to agree to a criminal trial much more likely. Jordan Chandler was brought straight to the cops and the cops didn't provide the Chandlers with witness protection, so they needed the money to protect themselves from MJ's psychotic fans. Fortunately, with the Arvizos, they got it right.</p>
				<p>Sure, MJ claimed he was innocent and according to your logic, no criminal claims they are innocent, but that doesn't make it true. If MJ was innocent and the evidence backed him, why wouldn't MJ take it to trial and prove his innocence instead of paying for silence? MJ fans love to try to use the money against the Chandlers when it is more a testament for MJ's guilt.</p>
				
				<blockquote>3. “He had money so he beat the rap.” Martha Stewart, Paris Hilton, Chris Brown, Madoff, etc. I guess did not have enough money to beat the rap. Michael Jackson’s trial was one of the most expensive trials in U.S. History. It cost taxpayers 2.7 million dollars. Michael Jackson's Trial Cost $2,7 million - The Michael Jackson's trial cost the Santa Barbara County taxpayers about $2,7 million - Softpedia Sneddon had been chasing after Michael Jackson for 12 years and he still could not find any evidence or credible witnesses, despite ransacking Neverland twice with 70 police officers, setting up a hotline for alleged victims to come forward, and traveling around the world looking for victims. Also, I thought Michael Jackson was broke? Thats what all his detractors in 2005 claimed, while at the same time claiming he 'got off' because he was rich.</blockquote>
				
				<p>The difference was with Martha Stewart, she committed insider trading. If one thing is sacred above all else in the United States, it's the almighty dollar and by threatening the confidence of investors, that is verboten in the U.S. That's why the Enron board was criminally prosecuted for defrauding investors but not the CEO of British Petroleum for installing faulty pipelines.</p>
				
				<blockquote>4. “OJ Simpson got away with it, so Michael Jackson got away with it too.” People who think OJ is guilty can point to evidence, something that MJ haters have a hard time doing. By that same logic, Charles Manson is also innocent because some people are wrongfully convicted. Therefore, we should release all convicted criminals from prison. RUBBISH</blockquote>
				
				<p>Actually, MJ realists have provided mountains of evidence that supports MJ's guilt, so your point that "People who think OJ is guilty can point to evidence, something that MJ haters have a hard time doing" is factually incorrect. People have convicted with less evidence, Gary Glitter comes to mind.</p>
				
				<blockquote>5. "He sleeps with boys." This is not illegal. If you want to use this as proof of his guilt, then at a minimum the boys he's sleeping with have to be the ones accusing him, NOT you. This didn‘t happen in the Michael Jackson case, contrary to popular belief. Gavin Arvizo the boy accusing him in 2005 never slept in bed with Michael Jackson, according to the Martin Bashir interview and witnesses at the trial. He slept in the guest room with his family. Macaulay Culkin, Wade Robson, and Bert Lewis, all testified they slept with Jackson in the early 90s and nothing happened. Do you know better than them what happened to them? The maid's son was not even one of Jackson 'special friends' as the prosecution liked to call the boys he supposedly 'groomed'. That kid was never invited on any vacations or given any expensive presents and never invited into Michael Jackson's bed. His claims that Michael Jackson molested him actually contradicts the prosecution previous portrayal of Michael Jackson as a serial pedophile who carefully choose and grooms his victims. According to the maid's son Jackson is an impulsive pedophile who stick his hands into the pants of any random kids who happen to be hanging around the place. LMAO! Jordie Chandler who is the only accuser to sleep with Jackson, (the boy got the settlement in the early 90s) skipped the country so he wouldn't have to testify in the 2005 case. Gee, I wonder why? Also, witnesses at the trial testified that their were a few girls who slept in Michael Jackson's bed, one of which was Macauley Culkin's sister in the early 90s.</blockquote>
				
				<p>His victims ARE accusing him, that's the point. Jordan Chandler claimed that MJ engaged in mutual masturbation with him. Additionally, during the Martin Bashir interview, Gavin was likely still under MJ's influence. Wade Robson was also under MJ's influence until a couple of years ago when he finally recanted his testimony in MJ's favour. He admitted that he lied at the request of Michael Jackson. MJ took Jordan Chandler to Monaco with him. As for Jordan Chandler not wanting to testify in the 2005 case, considering how his family was targeted by MJ's crazy fans during his allegations, why would he want to subject himself to that again?</p>
				
				<blockquote>6. “There was ‘lurid’ testimony. 'Jesus Juice!!!' ‘Little boys never lie’. When a child speaks we should believe them…” I can give lurid testimony about you too. I wonder if that makes it true. Here’s one of my favorites from you tube. On the witch hunt for victims Diane Diamond comes across a boy who could give ‘lurid testimony’ that Michael Jackson molested him and details of his time at Neverland. She believed him and wasted months trying to corroborate his story and even gets the police involved. Turned out this kids a liar who’d never even met Michael Jackson.</blockquote>
				
				<p>By your logic, no child has ever been molested, no woman has ever been raped, etc. Just because you can lie doesn't mean that victims of child molestation and rape are lying.</p>
				
				<blockquote>7. "Would you leave you're kids with him?" I wouldn't leave my kids with you either. That must be proof that you are a child molester. Michael Jackson has been around the children of countless celebrities, including Yoko Ono’s son, Paul McCartney’s children, Quincy Jones kids, Whoopi Goldberg, and business associates. They all knew him and judged it was safe for their kids to be around him. So every idiot using this line of reasoning needs to get a clue.</blockquote>
				
				<p>So, you're saying that just because countless celebrities endangered their children by having them near a serial child molester, that magically means he's no longer a serial child molester?</p>
				
				<blockquote>8. "He chose his victims carefully, that explains why all his accusers are con-artists" If he was so slick of a pedophile to 'carefully choose his victims', maybe he would have been slick enough to know not to come on TV and announce to the world 'the most beautiful thing you could do is share your bed with a child'. LOL. Michael Jackson had nothing to hide from anybody. If he's pedophile he was doing it in everybody's face for the past 30 years of his life. He was parading his supposed 'victims' around with him in public, taking them to the Grammys and other award show. He's babbling on and on about how special children are since the late 70s. He mentions children in almost every interview. I read Quincy Jone's autobiography and in it he explains how close Michael Jackson was with his daughter who was 8 when Jackson was 20. He recounted an incident when his wife discovered that his daughter had made more than 91 phone calls to Michael Jackson. Therefore, Quincy's daughter must have been one Michael Jackson's first 'victims'. Only people with sick minds think that every close relationship has to be sexual. If Michael Jackson wanted have sex with kids, there are a lot smarter ways to go about doing it. He didn't have to build Neverland or waste time 'grooming' anybody. He could travel to some foreign country and secretly buy children to molest in private and he would never have been caught because he had enough money and resources to keep his activities hidden.</blockquote>
				
				<p>MJ, like many men who get away with these horrific crimes, likes to flaunt the fact that he beat the system to the media. After all, OJ Simpson wrote a book called "If I Did It".</p>
				
				<blockquote>9."PORN+ALCOHOL+CHILDREN=CHILD MOLESTER" This has to be the dumbest. How many households in America can you find the same things; therefore, every parent who owns porn and has alcohol in their house must also be molesting children. Please. There is no evidence that Jackson either showed the boy porn or gave him alcohol, other than the testimony of the boy and his family who I said before had no problem lying about being kidnapped and held prisoner. Fact is, the police found nothing incriminating , no Kiddie porn, or naked pictures of boys. The only thing they found was this, http://mjjshop.com/shop/images/whyplasticase.jpg, a publicity photo of him promoting his nephews’ album and a legal art book sent to him by fans.</blockquote>
				
				<blockquote>If you are an intelligent person read, Aphrodite Jones's book 'The Michael Jackson Conspiracy' and Geraldine Hugh's book 'Redemption' and the GQ article, Was Michael Jackson Framed?. If you won't read the evidence than just be quiet and quit slandering an innocent man's name. Its a shame anyone continues to claim with conviction 'Michael Jackson was a pedophile' given all the evidence thats out their. I don't even think its appropriate to claim they even 'think' that Michael Jackson is a pedophile given all the evidence. The only thing these haters can do is just say 'we will never know' what happened because we weren't there. All Michael Jackson's fans should also research the cases, so they can respond intelligently to all the ignorant fools who continue rehash those nonsensical claims as evidence that Michael Jackson was a pedophile.</blockquote>
